# Downloading Files with Python - Synchronously

This folder contains code used to create a downloads folder, iteratively download files from a list of uris, unzip them and delete zip files.

Code is modularised and split into main.py and helper_functions.py scripts with the latter supplying utility functions to the main.py file.

Error handling is included to accomodate bad uris.
